# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: Dart  
**Primary Dependencies**: Flutter  
**Storage**: Local storage  
**Testing**: flutter_test (unit, widget, and integration tests)  
**Target Platform**: iPhone and Android
**Project Type**: Native Mobile App  
**Performance Goals**: Smooth 60 fps animations and UI transitions.  
**Constraints**: Must be fully functional offline. All data is stored locally.  
**Scale/Scope**: MVP for a single user. Manages up to 10 series with 50 events each.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. Specification-Driven Development**: Does the `spec.md` exist and is it complete?
- **II. Template-Driven Consistency**: Is this plan following the standard template?
- **III. Progressive Enhancement**: Are user stories prioritized and independently testable?
- **IV. Quality Gates**: Has the spec passed its quality checklist?
- **V. Tool Integration**: Does the proposed workflow support automation?

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
