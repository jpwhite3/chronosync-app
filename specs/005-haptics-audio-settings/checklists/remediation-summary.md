- **After**: 33 functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-033, with some sub-letters)
- **Added**: 6 major new requirements + 10 sub-requirements

### Success Criteria Clarity
- **Before**: Some vague measurements ("under 30 seconds", "90% of users")
- **After**: All criteria have specific measurement methodologies, sample sizes, or enumerated test cases

### Accessibility Coverage
- **Before**: 0 accessibility requirements
- **After**: 4 comprehensive accessibility requirements (FR-030 to FR-033)

### Edge Case Handling
- **Before**: 6 edge cases with some ambiguity
- **After**: 7 edge cases with specific requirement references and detailed resolution steps

---

## Validation

To verify all changes were properly applied:

1. ✅ All new FR-XXX requirements are sequential and properly numbered
2. ✅ All new requirements reference checklist items they address
3. ✅ Clarifications section documents the enhancement rationale
4. ✅ Edge cases reference specific functional requirements (traceability)
5. ✅ Success criteria are now measurable and testable
6. ✅ Accessibility requirements meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review updated spec.md** - Verify all changes align with product vision
2. **Update plan.md** - May need to reflect new accessibility dependencies
3. **Update data-model.md** - Ensure validation rules align with FR-028
4. **Update contracts** - May need to add accessibility-related interfaces
5. **Re-run checklist** - Mark resolved items as complete `[x]`
6. **Generate tasks** - Run `/speckit.tasks` to create implementation tasks

## Statistics

- **Checklist items reviewed**: 110
- **Items resolved in spec**: 42
- **Items deferred to other docs**: 28
- **Items covered by existing requirements**: 25
- **Items marked N/A**: 15
- **Resolution rate**: 86% (95/110 addressed or validated)

**Outcome**: Specification is now significantly more complete, clear, consistent, and ready for implementation. All critical gaps in requirements quality have been addressed.
