**Depth Level**: Standard Review Gate - thorough validation suitable for PR review with balanced coverage across all quality dimensions

**Usage**: Review each item and mark complete `[x]` when the requirement quality aspect has been validated. Items marked `[Gap]` indicate missing requirements that should be added. Items marked `[Ambiguity]` or `[Conflict]` indicate existing requirements that need clarification or resolution.

**Next Steps After Review**:
1. Address all `[Gap]` items by adding missing requirements to spec.md
2. Resolve all `[Ambiguity]` and `[Conflict]` items by clarifying or updating existing requirements
3. Update `[Clarity]` items to make vague requirements more specific and measurable
4. Ensure all `[Traceability]` items have proper cross-references between documents
5. Re-run this checklist after updates to verify all quality issues resolved
