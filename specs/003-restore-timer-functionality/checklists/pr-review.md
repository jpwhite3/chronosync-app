# Requirements Quality Checklist: Restore Timer Functionality

**Purpose**: PR review checklist validating requirement quality, clarity, completeness, and consistency for the timer regression fix. This checklist tests whether the requirements are well-written and ready for implementation, NOT whether the implementation works correctly.

**Created**: October 23, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md) | [plan.md](../plan.md) | [tasks.md](../tasks.md)  
**Audience**: Peer reviewers during PR review  
**Depth**: Standard PR review (comprehensive quality validation)
