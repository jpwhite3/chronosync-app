# Specification Quality Checklist: Restore Timer Functionality

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: October 23, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items have been validated and pass the quality requirements:

### Content Quality
- ✅ Specification avoids mentioning Flutter, Dart, BLoC, or any framework-specific details
- ✅ All sections focus on what users need (display timers, see countdown/count-up, progress to next event)
- ✅ Language is accessible to event coordinators and business stakeholders
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness
- ✅ Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers in specification
- ✅ All 18 functional requirements are specific, measurable, and testable (e.g., "MUST display both timers simultaneously", "MUST turn red at 00:00")
- ✅ Success criteria include quantifiable metrics (e.g., "within 1 second", "under 500ms", "4 inches screen")
- ✅ Success criteria avoid implementation details (e.g., "timer accuracy maintained" not "Timer.periodic accuracy")
- ✅ Each user story includes detailed Given-When-Then acceptance scenarios
- ✅ Edge cases cover boundary conditions (single event, long durations, backgrounding, short durations, hour transitions)
- ✅ Scope is clearly bounded to timer display restoration only, not new features
- ✅ Assumptions section documents existing components and their expected state

### Feature Readiness
- ✅ Each FR maps to acceptance scenarios (FR-001 to US1, FR-007-009 to US2, FR-011-015 to US3)
- ✅ Three user stories cover all primary flows: dual timer display, overtime behavior, event progression
- ✅ All 7 success criteria are measurable and verifiable without implementation knowledge
- ✅ Specification maintains abstraction layer - describes behavior not code

## Notes

This specification is ready to proceed to the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).

The feature is a regression fix, restoring functionality from 001-chronosync-mvp that was inadvertently broken during 002-swipe-delete-items implementation. The specification clearly documents the expected behavior based on the MVP requirements.

Key strengths:
- Clear priority ordering (all P1 - critical functionality)
- Specific, testable requirements with measurable outcomes
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Well-documented assumptions about existing system state
- Technology-agnostic language throughout
