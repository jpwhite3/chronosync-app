## Priority Gap Analysis

### Critical Gaps (P0) - MUST Resolve Before Implementation
1. **Error Handling Missing** (A7.1-A7.5) - No requirements for auto-progress failures, statistics errors, audio failures, timer errors, or migration errors
2. **Accessibility Requirements Missing** (A8.1-A8.7) - No screen reader, color-blind, or keyboard support specified
3. **Visual Feedback Duration** (A3.2, B1.1, I1.1) - "Brief" indicator is ambiguous and not testable
4. **Audio Cue Design** (A3.7, I2.1) - No sound type/duration specified for audio feedback

### High Priority Gaps (P1) - SHOULD Resolve Before Implementation
5. **Statistics Panel Design** (A4.9, B1.3, I1.2) - "Prominently positioned" lacks concrete placement/layout
6. **Background Timeout Handling** (A5.4) - No spec for long background duration (hours/days)
7. **Log Format** (A6.4-A6.5) - No log structure or retention policy
8. **Error Flow Scenarios** (E3.1-E3.4) - No test scenarios for failure cases
9. **Boundary Conditions** (F1.1, F1.3-F1.4, F1.6-F1.7) - Missing edge cases for extreme values
10. **State Transition Edge Cases** (F2.3-F2.4, F2.6) - Missing specs for mid-transition background, crash recovery, first event handling

### Medium Priority Gaps (P2) - SHOULD Resolve Before Release
11. **Performance NFRs** (G1.6-G1.8) - Frame rate target, memory, and battery constraints missing
12. **Usability NFRs** (G2.3-G2.5) - Discoverability, error messages, undo mechanism missing
13. **Reliability NFRs** (G4.1-G4.4) - Failure handling, crash recovery missing
14. **Security/Privacy** (G5.1-G5.3) - PII handling, encryption, permissions missing
15. **Compatibility NFRs** (G7.1-G7.3) - OS versions, device list, backwards compatibility missing

### Low Priority Gaps (P3) - CAN Defer
16. **Alternative Flow Scenarios** (E2.2, E2.4) - Disable auto-progress, no auto-progress series
17. **Data Integrity Edge Cases** (F3.1-F3.4) - Migration handling, corruption, overflow, deletion
18. **Concurrent Operations** (F4.2-F4.4) - Live editing, multiple series
19. **External Factors** (F5.1-F5.4) - System time change, low battery, audio interruption, device lock
20. **Implicit Assumptions Validation** (H4.1-H4.5) - Single series, positive durations, non-empty series, audio availability

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Before Implementation)
1. ✅ **Add P0 Error Handling Requirements** - Define behavior for all failure modes (estimated: 1-2 hours)
2. ✅ **Add P0 Accessibility Requirements** - Specify screen reader, color-blind, keyboard support (estimated: 2-3 hours)
3. ✅ **Quantify Visual Feedback Duration** - Replace "brief" with specific duration (e.g., 1.5-2 seconds) (estimated: 15 minutes)
4. ✅ **Specify Audio Cue Design** - Define sound type, duration, and fallback (estimated: 30 minutes)
5. ✅ **Detail Statistics Panel Layout** - Add wireframe or position specs (estimated: 1 hour)

### Before Implementation Complete (P1 Resolution)
6. ✅ **Document Background Timeout Behavior** - Specify max background duration and handling (estimated: 30 minutes)
7. ✅ **Define Log Format & Retention** - Specify log structure and retention policy (estimated: 1 hour)
8. ✅ **Add Error Flow Test Scenarios** - Create acceptance scenarios for failures (estimated: 1-2 hours)
9. ✅ **Document Boundary Condition Behavior** - Specify extreme value handling (estimated: 1 hour)
10. ✅ **Add State Transition Edge Case Specs** - Define mid-transition, crash, first event behaviors (estimated: 1-2 hours)

### Before Release (P2 Resolution)
11. ⚠️ **Add Performance NFRs** - Specify frame rate, memory, battery targets (estimated: 1 hour)
12. ⚠️ **Add Usability NFRs** - Define discoverability, error messages, undo (estimated: 2 hours)
13. ⚠️ **Add Reliability NFRs** - Specify failure handling and crash recovery (estimated: 1-2 hours)
14. ⚠️ **Add Security/Privacy Requirements** - Define PII handling, encryption, permissions (estimated: 1-2 hours)
15. ⚠️ **Add Compatibility NFRs** - Specify OS versions, devices, backwards compatibility (estimated: 1 hour)

### Post-Release Improvements (P3 Deferrable)
16. 🔵 **Add Alternative Flow Scenarios** - Document disable/no-auto-progress flows (estimated: 1 hour)
17. 🔵 **Add Data Integrity Specs** - Define migration, corruption, overflow handling (estimated: 2 hours)
18. 🔵 **Add Concurrent Operation Specs** - Define live editing, multiple series behavior (estimated: 1-2 hours)
19. 🔵 **Add External Factor Specs** - Define time change, battery, audio interruption behavior (estimated: 1-2 hours)
20. 🔵 **Validate Implicit Assumptions** - Confirm and document single series, validation rules (estimated: 1 hour)

**Total Estimated Resolution Time**:
- P0 (Critical): 4-7 hours
- P1 (High): 5-8 hours
- P2 (Medium): 6-9 hours
- P3 (Low): 7-10 hours
- **Grand Total**: 22-34 hours to achieve 95%+ quality score

## Conclusion

**Current Quality Assessment**: FAIR (68%)

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Excellent acceptance criteria quality (100% testable scenarios)
- ✅ Excellent traceability (93% - clear mapping between user stories, requirements, and success criteria)
- ✅ Excellent consistency (95% - minimal conflicts, clear terminology)
- ✅ Strong clarity & precision (78% - most requirements quantified)
- ✅ Good requirement completeness (75% - core functionality covered)

**Critical Gaps**:
- ❌ Accessibility requirements completely missing (0/7 items)
- ❌ Error handling requirements completely missing (0/5 items)
- ❌ Edge case coverage insufficient (34% - many boundary conditions unspecified)
- ❌ Non-functional requirements insufficient (37% - performance/usability/reliability gaps)
- ❌ Ambiguous language not resolved (28% clear - "brief", "prominently", audio design undefined)

**Recommendation**: 
**DO NOT START IMPLEMENTATION** until P0 gaps are resolved (estimated 4-7 hours). The spec has a solid foundation (user stories, acceptance criteria, traceability) but critical gaps in error handling and accessibility could cause significant rework. Resolve P0 + P1 gaps (9-15 hours total) to achieve 85%+ quality score and safe implementation readiness.

**Next Steps**:
1. Review this checklist with stakeholders
2. Prioritize gap resolution using P0-P3 framework above
3. Update spec.md with resolved gaps
4. Re-run checklist to validate improvements
5. Proceed to implementation only after P0 + P1 resolution confirmed

## Checklist Usage Guide

**For Spec Authors**:
- Use this checklist during spec writing to ensure completeness before review
- Address ❌ MISSING and ⚠️ PARTIAL items in your current section before moving to next
- Run through all sections before declaring spec "ready for review"

**For Reviewers**:
- Use this checklist as your review guide - each item is a review question
- Focus on ❌ MISSING items first (highest risk)
- Validate that ✅ items are actually complete (spot check)

**For Implementers**:
- Use this checklist to identify ambiguities before starting coding
- If an item is ❌ MISSING or ⚠️ PARTIAL, clarify with spec author before implementing
- Add implementation notes as you discover additional gaps

**For QA/Testers**:
- Section D (Acceptance Criteria Quality) is your test plan foundation
- Section F (Edge Cases) is your exploratory testing guide
- Use ❌ MISSING items to propose additional test scenarios

*This checklist follows the principle of "unit tests for English" - each item validates a specific aspect of requirement quality, enabling systematic validation before implementation begins.*
