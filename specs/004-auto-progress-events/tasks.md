# Tasks: Auto-Progress Events with Series Statistics

**Input**: Design documents from `/Users/jpwhite/Code/cronos-app/specs/004-auto-progress-events/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ‚úÖ, spec.md ‚úÖ, research.md ‚úÖ, data-model.md ‚úÖ, contracts/ ‚úÖ

**Tests**: Unit tests and widget tests included per quickstart.md guidance

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

This is a Flutter mobile application with the following structure:
- **Source**: `chronosync/lib/`
- **Tests**: `chronosync/test/`
- **Assets**: `chronosync/assets/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (1-2 hours)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and data model preparation for auto-progress feature

- [X] T001 Add just_audio dependency (^0.9.36) to chronosync/pubspec.yaml
- [X] T002 Create assets/audio/ directory and add auto_progress_beep.mp3 audio file
- [X] T003 Update chronosync/pubspec.yaml to include audio asset (assets/audio/auto_progress_beep.mp3)
- [X] T004 Run `flutter pub get` to fetch new dependencies
- [X] T005 Create lib/data/models/series_statistics.dart with SeriesStatistics class (transient model)

**Checkpoint**: Dependencies installed, assets configured, base statistics model created ‚úÖ

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites) (1-2 hours)

**Purpose**: Core data model updates that MUST be complete before ANY user story implementation

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T006 Add autoProgress field (bool, default false) to Event model in lib/data/models/event.dart
- [X] T007 Add autoProgressAudioEnabled field (bool, default true) to UserPreferences model in lib/data/models/user_preferences.dart
- [X] T008 Run `flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` to regenerate type adapters
- [X] T009 Create unit test for Event.autoProgress default value in test/data/models/event_test.dart
- [X] T010 Create unit test for UserPreferences.autoProgressAudioEnabled default in test/data/models/user_preferences_test.dart
- [X] T011 Create unit tests for SeriesStatistics computed properties in test/data/models/series_statistics_test.dart
- [X] T012 Run `flutter test` to verify data model tests pass

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - all data models updated and tested, user story implementation can now begin ‚úÖ

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Enable Auto-Progress on Individual Events (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP (1-2 hours)

**Goal**: Allow users to toggle auto-progress setting when creating or editing events, with visual indication in event list

**Independent Test**: Create a new event with auto-progress enabled, save it, edit the event, verify toggle state persists, and check that the event list shows an auto-progress indicator icon

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [X] T017 [US1] Add tooltip or subtitle text "Auto-progress when time expires" to toggle in lib/presentation/screens/event_list_screen.dart

**Manual Test Checkpoint**: 
1. Create new event with auto-progress ON ‚Üí Save ‚Üí Edit ‚Üí Verify toggle shows ON
2. Create new event with auto-progress OFF ‚Üí Save ‚Üí Edit ‚Üí Verify toggle shows OFF (default)

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Fully Automated Series Execution (Priority: P2) (30 minutes)

**Goal**: Enable hands-free execution when all events in a series have auto-progress enabled

**Independent Test**: Create a series with 3-5 events (15-30 seconds each), all with auto-progress ON. Start the series and observe it progress automatically from start to completion without any manual intervention.

**Note**: This user story is primarily enabled by User Story 2 implementation - no additional code changes required, but testing validates the end-to-end flow.

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T042 [US3] Verify existing LiveTimerBloc logic supports chaining multiple auto-progress events in lib/logic/live_timer_bloc/live_timer_bloc.dart

1. Create series with 5 events: all 20 seconds, all auto-progress ON
2. Start series ‚Üí Hands off (do not touch any buttons)
3. Verify: All 5 events advance automatically
4. Verify: Visual indicators appear on each transition
5. Verify: Completion screen displays after final event
6. Success criteria: SC-003 (fully automated series runs smoothly)

---

**Goal**: Show statistics panel (event count, expected time, actual time, over/under time) on series completion screen

**Independent Test**: Run any series to completion (manual or auto-progress), verify statistics panel displays above "Back to Series" button with all four statistics calculated correctly and color-coded.

- [ ] T054 [US4] Create unit test for SeriesStatistics formatted string methods in test/data/models/series_statistics_test.dart
- [ ] T055 [US4] Run `flutter test` to verify User Story 4 tests pass

1. Create series: Event A (1 min), Event B (1 min), Event C (1 min)
2. Scenario 1: Complete all events on time ‚Üí Verify over/under shows "00:00" neutral color
3. Scenario 2: Let Event A run 30s overtime ‚Üí Verify over/under shows "+00:30" in red
4. Scenario 3: Press NEXT early on Event B (20s remaining) ‚Üí Verify over/under shows "-00:20" in green
5. Scenario 4: Mixed (overtime on A, undertime on B) ‚Üí Verify cumulative over/under calculation
6. Success criteria: SC-004 (panel visible without scrolling), SC-005 (statistics calculate within 1 second)

**Manual Test Checkpoint**: 
1. Start series with 1-minute auto-progress event
2. Wait 30 seconds ‚Üí Background the app (press home button)
3. Wait 40 seconds (total 70 seconds, event should have auto-progressed at 60s)
4. Foreground the app ‚Üí Verify auto-progression triggers within 2 seconds
5. Success criteria: SC-008 (auto-progression triggers within 2 seconds of foregrounding)

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1 but may benefit from US1 for testing
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on User Story 2 completion (auto-progression logic required)
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1/US2/US3, can run in parallel with US2
- **Background Handling (Phase 7)**: Depends on User Story 2 completion (enhances auto-progression)
- **Edge Cases & Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- Must complete before any user story work

**Phase 3 (User Story 1)**:
- T013-T014 (toggle in create/edit dialogs) can run in parallel
- T016-T017 (visual indicator + tooltip) can run in parallel after T015

**Phase 4 (User Story 2)**:
- T018-T021 (state/event updates) can run in parallel
- T029-T030 (settings state) can run in parallel with T018-T021
- T033 (AutoProgressIndicator widget) can run in parallel with BLoC work
- T036-T040 (all tests) can run in parallel after implementation

**Phase 6 (User Story 4)**:
- T046 (SeriesStatisticsPanel widget) can run in parallel with T049 (formatted time methods)
- T052-T054 (all tests) can run in parallel after implementation

**Phase 8 (Edge Cases & Polish)**:
- T062-T063 (validation/display time) can run in parallel
- T069-T070 (documentation) can run in parallel with testing
- T072-T073 (analysis/coverage) can run in parallel

### Parallel Example: User Story 2 BLoC Layer

```bash
# Launch these tasks together:
Task T018: "Add fields to LiveTimerRunning state"
Task T019: "Add shouldAutoProgress computed property"
Task T020: "Update LiveTimerComplete state"
Task T021: "Add AutoProgressTriggered event class"

# These can also run in parallel with above:
Task T029: "Add autoProgressAudioEnabled to SettingsState"
Task T030: "Update SettingsState.copyWith"
Task T033: "Create AutoProgressIndicator widget"
```
